IMPORTANT NOTE PLEASE READ: When I build and ran the game it was working fine but when I put it on github, even with gitignore it wouldn't take the file because it was over 25 GB so I had to copy the file without the build. I hope that you understand and I worked with a few people and they didn't know what to do at that point. I think that the build made it too big so it couldn't submit it but the zip file that I have submitted to you thru webcourses has the build though. I did put it in a sepreate file in the respiratory called "build". So that you can run the game without any troubles. I hope that is ok.
